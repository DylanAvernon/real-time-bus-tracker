# real-time-bus-tracker

## Project Description
This project pulls data from MBTA using their API and displays the results using MapBox GL.

The original project was an assignment for MIT xPro's web development bootcamp. I expanded on the project by pulling in more data from MBTA and color coding buses based on the route they follow. All buses that follow the same route have the same marker color.

## How to Run
You can run this project by cloning the repository to you local machine. Then you can drag and drop the index.html file into your web browser.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
I want to expand this project by including an on hover feature that allows users of the application to see the number of available seats.
